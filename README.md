# This is a collection of shell scripts I've wriiten over the time.
## get_defcon_vid.sh
This script fetched the RSS files from <https://media.defcon.org/>, extracts the urls to the .m4v files, writes them to a list and if you want downloads them.
Since there are only videos of DEFCON 7 to 19 this script is a little static, so if anything changes (i.e. filenames), this script wont't work anymore.
I haven't testet the download yet, but I think it should work.
